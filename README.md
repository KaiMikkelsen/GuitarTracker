## Problems I have faced:

- STM32 Board not recognized as USB Device
- Solution: Had to use a different cable, (the one for my wireless beats headphones)

- Serial communication not working
- Solution: Created a fresh new project and used UART2 instead of Uart1?


## Hours

January 5th
- 2 Hours: Trying to get it plugged in unsuccessfully, experiemnting with STLink
January 6th
- 2 Hours: Got it connecting with a better cable, reading adc values from a potentiometer
January 7th
-2 Hours: Trying and failing to get serial communication working, sound sensor not really working.
January 8th
- x hours: Serial communication solved! looking into using a microphone IC instead of piezo buzzer as my electronics knowledge is lacking
